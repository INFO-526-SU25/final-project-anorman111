This dataset was sourced from the [FBI's Crime Data API](#0) and curated by [Ford Johnson](#0) for the [TidyTuesday project on February 18, 2025](#0). The data includes law enforcement participation in the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), agency names, type (county/city), geographic location, and reporting start date.

I selected this dataset because it includes geographic variables such as `longitude`, `latitude`, `state`, and `county` that can be used for location-specific and state-level map visualizations. Participating agencies also have a `start_date`, which will allow for visualizations of timelines and pattern changes. My work involves research on infectious diseases, so improving my skills in these areas would be useful for communicating information such as outbreak data trends.

## Questions

1.  Are there patterns of NIBRS adoption by region or agency type?
2.  How has NIBRS participation expanded geographically over time?

## Analysis plan

-   Question 1: Current participation levels have been explored above at the state level and graphed on the bar chart titled *Agency Participation by State,* which compares total and number of participating agencies within states and includes the percentage reporting to NIBRS as labels. I plan to build on this to further explore patterns and trends by agency type and region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).
    -   Quantitative Methods: Calculate proportion of participating agencies (`report_status==TRUE`) within each `region` and by `agency_type`, if time permits, significance tests may be explored.
    -   Visual Methods: Bar or dot plots for side-by-side comparisons - other options for visual comparison may be explored as well.
    -   Variables:
        -   `state`: to summarize participation by state and region
        -   `county`: to potentially be used for a more detailed look at specific areas within states or across certain regions
        -   `agency_type`: for comparing participation across agency types
        -   `report_status`: variable for determining participation status
        -   `region`: states grouped to 4 US Census regions based on definitions referenced from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/sources-definitions/geographic-region.htm) website. Full list and map of states by region included below:

agencies |>
  distinct(state, region) |>
  plot_usmap(
  data=_,
    values = "region",
    exclude=c("District of Columbia"), #DC not in agencies so it needs to be explicitly excluded when using usmap
    color = "white")+ 
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = "Region", 
    values=c(
      "Northeast"="steelblue3",
      "Midwest"="mediumorchid",
      "South"="deeppink2",
      "West"="coral")) + 
  labs(title = "US Regions")+
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

-   Question 2: Similar to Question 1, I will build off of the current participation calculations to analyze participation expansion over time. While the `usmap` package was utilized to create the map above, but I do not belive it has coordinate plotting capabilities. Alternatives will be explored but I may change to county plotting if needed for time restraints.
    -   Quantitative Methods: Rates of adoption will be calculated for each year and/or time period - potentially as trend lines for general direction and rates of adoption or growth curves for cumulative change.
    -   Visual Methods: Faceted maps to show changes in participation over time covering 1985-2024 (likely groups of either 5 or 10 years - e.g., 1985-1994, 1995-2004, 2005-2014, 2015-2024) - may also explore animation if possible. Depending on the final quantitative methods, other visualizations such as line charts, bar plots, or cumulative growth curves may be included to help represent results over time.
    -   Variables:
        -   `start_date`: will provide years when agencies began reporting to NIBRS
        -   `latitude` and `longitude`: will be used for mapping agency locations
            -   `county` will be used as an alternative if using `usmap` package
        -   `report_status`: variable for determining participation status
