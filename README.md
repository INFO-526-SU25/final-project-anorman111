#Final Project

Final Project repo for INFO 526 - Summer 2025.

This repository contains the Quarto source files for my INFO 526 final project, which explores law enforcement participation in the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) using U.S. Census and FBI data.

#### **Final Project Website:** <https://anorman111.github.io/project/>

*Due to deployment issues with the course GitHub Pages setup, the final site is hosted on my personal GitHub Pages. Please use the link above to view the rendered project.*

### Project Overview

The analysis addresses two main questions:

1.  **NIBRS Participation by State and Agency Type**\
    Which U.S. states and regions have lower levels of NIBRS adoption, and are there patterns by geography or agency type?

2.  **NIBRS Participation Over Time**\
    How has NIBRS participation expanded geographically from 1985 to 2024?

The project includes maps, diverging bar plots, and a decade-by-decade visualization of agency participation.
