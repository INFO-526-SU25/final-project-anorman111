I plan to build on this to further explore patterns and trends by agency type and region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).\n\nQuantitative Methods: Calculate proportion of participating agencies (report_status==TRUE) within each region and by agency_type, if time permits, significance tests may be explored.\nVisual Methods: Bar or dot plots for side-by-side comparisons - other options for visual comparison may be explored as well.\nVariables:\n\nstate: to summarize participation by state and region\ncounty: to potentially be used for a more detailed look at specific areas within states or across certain regions\nagency_type: for comparing participation across agency types\nreport_status: variable for determining participation status\nregion: states grouped to 4 US Census regions based on definitions referenced from the CDC website.

While the usmap package was utilized to create the map above, but I do not believe it has coordinate plotting capabilities. Alternatives will be explored but I may change to county plotting if needed for time restraints.\n\nQuantitative Methods: Rates of adoption will be calculated for each year and/or time period - potentially as trend lines for general direction and rates of adoption or growth curves for cumulative change.\nVisual Methods: Faceted maps to show changes in participation over time covering 1985-2024 (likely groups of either 5 or 10 years - e.g., 1985-1994, 1995-2004, 2005-2014, 2015-2024) - may also explore animation if possible. Depending on the final quantitative methods, other visualizations such as line charts, bar plots, or cumulative growth curves may be included to help represent results over time.\nVariables:\n\nstart_date: will provide years when agencies began reporting to NIBRS\nlatitude and longitude: will be used for mapping agency locations\n\ncounty will be used as an alternative if using usmap package\n\nreport_status: variable for determining participation status"

    "text": "Question 1: NIBRS Participation by State and Agency Type\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuestion: Which U.S. states and regions have lower levels of NIBRS adoption by law enforcement agencies, and are there patterns by geography or agency type?\nHypothesis: States with a mix of large cities and rural areas will have lower NIBRS participation due to variation in agency structure and a higher number of total agencies.\n\nThis question focuses no identifying U.S. states and regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) with the lowest levels of participation in NIBRS. Agency-level data was used to summarize participation status by state, then regional classifications were added to group the results by area. Agency type was also included to determine if low compliance rates were driven by common types (city, county) or more likely to occur in areas with a wider variety of smaller agencies.\n\n\nApproach\nTwo visualizations were created to explore current NIBRS participation by region, state, and agency type. The first, FBI Crime Reporting Participation, is a series of maps that uses a 50 state layout of the United States with inserts of Alaska and Hawaii for ease of viewing and to align with the agencies dataset, which does not include any additional U.S. territories. The maps were created using the sf package to handle spacial data and state shapes via the tigris package. There are two regional maps (with and without state outlines) that use grouped results for percent participation by region, as well as a state-level map with color fill representing participation levels. Plot animation was attempted using gganimate, but issues with the multi-layer region-only map led to a switch to a simple GIF created using magick.\nThe second plot, Reported vs Not Reported Agencies by Type, is a horizontal diverging bar chart of the number of agencies within the 10 states with the lowest reporting percentages. Each bar is stacked by agency type and split by reporting status (reporting on the right, non-reporting on the left). This format shows allows for visualization of the total number of agencies within these states, while allowing for division by agency type and reporting status. It was chosen to complement the map plot by providing more detail on the least compliant states and answer the second half of the Question 1.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nCode\nQ1_map_function &lt;- function(participation_column, subtitles, color1, region_outlines=NULL) {\n  Q1_map &lt;- ggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data=us_states, aes(fill={{ participation_column }}), color=color1, linewidth=0.5)\n  \n  # Layer only for region outlines\n  if (!is.null(region_outlines)) {\n    Q1_map &lt;- Q1_map + geom_sf(data=region_outlines, fill=NA, color=\"white\", linewidth=0.5)\n  }\n  Q1_map + scale_fill_viridis_c(\n      option=\"plasma\", direction=-1,\n      limits=c(0, 1),\n      breaks=c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),\n      labels=percent_format(accuracy=1)\n    ) +\n    coord_sf(\n      xlim=c(usbbox[\"xmin\"], usbbox[\"xmax\"]),\n      ylim=c(usbbox[\"ymin\"], usbbox[\"ymax\"]),\n      expand=FALSE,\n      datum=NA\n    ) +\n    labs(\n      title=\"FBI Crime Reporting Participation\",\n      subtitle=subtitles,\n      caption=\"Source: Shapefiles obtained using {tigris} R package, v2.0.1.\\nNIBRS participation data sourced via the TidyTuesday project (Feb 18, 2025).\\nRegional groupings based on CDC definitions.\",\n      fill=\"Percent Participating\"\n    ) +\n    theme_void()\n}\n\nQ1map1 &lt;- Q1_map_function(\n  participation_column=Region_Participation,\n  subtitles=\"By Region\",\n  color1=NA,\n  region_outlines=region_shapes\n  )\n\nQ1map2 &lt;- Q1_map_function(\n  participation_column=Region_Participation,\n  subtitles=\"By Region\",\n  color1=\"white\"\n)\n\nQ1map3 &lt;- Q1_map_function(\n  participation_column=Percent_Participating,\n  subtitles=\"By State\",\n  color1=\"white\"\n)\n\n#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65571964/create-fade-in-and-fade-out-gif-in-r-magick-package\n\nggsave(path=\"images\", filename=\"Q1map1.png\", Q1map1, width=6, height=3.5, dpi=150)\nggsave(path=\"images\", filename=\"Q1map2.png\", Q1map2, width=6, height=3.5, dpi=150)\nggsave(path=\"images\", filename=\"Q1map3.png\", Q1map3, width=6, height=3.5, dpi=150)\n\nmap1png &lt;- image_read(\"images/Q1map1.png\")\nmap2png &lt;- image_read(\"images/Q1map2.png\")\nmap3png &lt;- image_read(\"images/Q1map3.png\")\n\nQ1gif &lt;-  c(map1png, map2png, map3png, map2png) |&gt;\n  image_morph(25) |&gt;\n  image_animate(fps=5, optimize=TRUE) |&gt;\n  suppressMessages()\n\nimage_write(Q1gif, \"images/Q1animation.gif\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nq1div &lt;- ggplot(agency_diverging, \n       aes(x=count, y=reorder(state, count), fill=agency_type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", position=\"stack\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=0, color=\"gray40\", linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option=\"plasma\") +  \n  labs(\n    title=\"Reported vs Not Reported Agencies by Type (10 lowest participation states)\",\n    caption=\"Source: FBI Crime Data API via the TidyTuesday project (Feb 18, 2025).\",\n    x=\"Number of Agencies (Not Reported | Reported)\",\n    y=\"State\",\n    fill=\"Agency Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggsave(path=\"images\", filename=\"Q1diverge.png\", q1div, width=6, height=3.5, dpi=150)\n\nq1div\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe map and regional summary revealed that the Northeast region has the lowest overall NIBRS participation rate among U.S. regions at 46% compared to other regions that ranged from 84-90%. At the state level, Pennsylvania had the lowest reporting percentage at 11%, followed by Florida at 18%. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Community & Economic Development, PA has more police departments than any other state, with over half having less than 10 officers each. The sheer number of agencies, coupled with their smaller sizes, explains why has a larger, more negative, bar on the diverging plot compared to high population states like FL and CA. It may also have an outsized influence on the region, helping to explain the large gap betweent the Northeast and other regions. Pennsylvania and Florida both have a large number of non-city agencies as well, which aligns with my hypothesis that variation in agencies would be a contributing factor, though PA has a larger number of “city” agency types in the non-reporting bucket."

I expect states with smaller populations to have higher adoption rates earlier, while more populous states will lag behind.\n\n\n\nApproach\nAgencies were grouped into decades based on when they joined NIBRS (1985-1994, 1995-2004, 2005-2014, 2015-2024). County data was obtained from tigris and joined to matching county names in the agencies.csv to approximately plot agency locations and visualize participation growth in each decade (longitude/latitude coordinates in the .csv resulted in more off-map points, either error on my end or a few incorrect points in the file). While a map with Hawaii and Alaska was used as the base, coordinates could not be mapped to the inserted states, so those agencies were removed as more realistic maps were difficult to read due to geographic spread. Results were faceted by decade to allow for growth comparisons.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nCode\nq2plot &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data=us_states, fill=\"gray90\", color=\"white\") +\n  geom_sf(\n    data=agencies_plot, \n    aes(color=decade), \n    size=0.7, alpha=0.6\n    ) +\n  scale_color_manual(name=\"Decade\", \n                     values=c(\"purple4\", \"cyan3\", \"darkblue\", \"magenta\")) +\n   labs(\n    title=\"Expansion of NIBRS Participation by Decade (1985–2024)\",\n    caption = \"Source: Shapefiles obtained using {tigris} R package, v2.0.1.\\nNIBRS join dates sourced via the TidyTuesday project (Feb 18, 2025).\\nHawaii and Alaska agencies excluded from plot\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(datum=NA) +\n  facet_wrap(~decade) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggsave(path=\"images\", filename=\"Q2plot.png\", q2plot, width=6, height=3.5, dpi=300)\n\nq2plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nDuring the earliest period (1985-1994), agency participation appears fairly high on the East coast but sparce in the West. More expansion is seen from 1995-2014, particularly in the Northwest. In the last decade, far more expansion is seen in the West and other areas continue to see increases in participation and are now densely covered. While difficult to quantify from these maps, the hypothesis appears to hold true for the Southwest, which had delayed but significant adoption during the last decade."

    "text": "This week we’re exploring data from the FBI Crime Data API! Specifically, we’re looking at agency-level data across all 50 states in the USA. This dataset provides details on law enforcement agencies that have submitted data to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program and are displayed on the Crime Data Explorer (CDE).\n\nCurrently, the FBI produces four annual publications from data provided by more than 18,000 federal, state, county, city, university and college, and tribal law enforcement agencies voluntarily participating in the UCR program.\nCrime data is dynamic. Offenses occur, arrests are made, and property is recovered every day. The FBI’s Crime Data Explorer, the digital front door for UCR data, is an attempt to reflect that fluidity in crime. The data presented there is updated regularly in a way that UCR publications previously could not be. Launched in 2017, the CDE’s content and features are updated and expanded continuously. CDE enables law enforcement agencies, researchers, journalists, and the public to more easily use and understand the massive amounts of UCR data using charts and graphs.\n\n\nHow do agency types vary? How are agencies distributed geographically within each state?\nWhat percentage of agencies in each state participate in NIBRS reporting? Are there any trends in NIBRS adoption?\n\nThank you to Ford Johnson for curating this week’s dataset.\n\n\n# Using R\n# Option 1: tidytuesdayR R package\n## install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-02-18')\n## OR\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 7)\n\nagencies &lt;- tuesdata$agencies\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub\n\nagencies &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-18/agencies.csv')\n# Using Python\n# Option 1: pydytuesday python library\n## pip install pydytuesday\n\nimport pydytuesday\n\n# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally\npydytuesday.get_date(\"2025-02-18\")\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object\n\nagencies = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-18/agencies.csv')\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data, watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about causation in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.\nCreate a visualization, a model, a Quarto report, a shiny app, or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R, Python, or another programming language.\nShare your output and the code used to generate it on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.\nSubmit your own dataset!\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the TidyTuesday data in Python?

There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.\nCreate a visualization, a model, a Quarto report, a shiny app, or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R, Python, or another programming language.\nShare your output and the code used to generate it on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.\nSubmit your own dataset!"
