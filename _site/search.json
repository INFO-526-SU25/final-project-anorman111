    "text": "Questions\n\nWhich U.S. states and regions have lower levels of NIBRS adoption by law enforcement agencies, and are there patterns by geography or agency type?\n\nHypothesis: States with a mix of large cities and rural areas will have lower NIBRS participation due to variation in agency structure and likelihood of having a large number of total agencies.\n\nHow has NIBRS participation expanded geographically from 1985 to 2024?\n\nHypothesis: NIBRS adoption has increased more rapidly in the last decade due to advancements in technology and broader adoption of centralized and streamlined data collection and reporting systems. I expect states with smaller populations to have higher adoption rates earlier, while more populous states will lag behind."

    "section": "Analysis plan",
    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nQuestion 1: Current participation levels have been explored above at the state level and graphed on the bar chart titled Agency Participation by State, which compares total and number of participating agencies within states and includes the percentage reporting to NIBRS as labels. I plan to build on this to further explore patterns and trends by agency type and region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).\n\nQuantitative Methods: Calculate proportion of participating agencies (report_status==TRUE) within each region and by agency_type, if time permits, significance tests may be explored.\nVisual Methods: Bar or dot plots for side-by-side comparisons - other options for visual comparison may be explored as well.\nVariables:\n\nstate: to summarize participation by state and region\ncounty: to potentially be used for a more detailed look at specific areas within states or across certain regions\nagency_type: for comparing participation across agency types\nreport_status: variable for determining participation status\nregion: states grouped to 4 US Census regions based on definitions referenced from the CDC website. Full list and map of states by region included below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      U.S. Regions\n    \n    \n    \n      Region\n      States\n    \n  \n  \n    Northeast\nConnecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont\n    Midwest\nIllinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin\n    South\nAlabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia\n    West\nAlaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming\n  \n  \n    \n      Regions defined by the CDC based on U.S. Census Bureau groupings,Source: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/sources-definitions/geographic-region.htm)\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: Similar to Question 1, I will build off of the current participation calculations to analyze participation expansion over time. While the usmap package was utilized to create the map above, but I do not believe it has coordinate plotting capabilities. Alternatives will be explored but I may change to county plotting if needed for time restraints.\n\nQuantitative Methods: Rates of adoption will be calculated for each year and/or time period - potentially as trend lines for general direction and rates of adoption or growth curves for cumulative change.\nVisual Methods: Faceted maps to show changes in participation over time covering 1985-2024 (likely groups of either 5 or 10 years - e.g., 1985-1994, 1995-2004, 2005-2014, 2015-2024) - may also explore animation if possible. Depending on the final quantitative methods, other visualizations such as line charts, bar plots, or cumulative growth curves may be included to help represent results over time.\nVariables:\n\nstart_date: will provide years when agencies began reporting to NIBRS\nlatitude and longitude: will be used for mapping agency locations\n\ncounty will be used as an alternative if using usmap package\n\nreport_status: variable for determining participation status"

NIBRS is a reporting system for collecting detailed, incident-level information on crimes. Introduced in the 1980’s, NIBRS has become the primary system for collecting and reporting crime data to the FBI after the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program was phased out and officially retired in 2021 (Ridgeway, 2024). The data set includes agency names, types (e.g., city, county, tribal), geographic details, and reporting start dates."

    "text": "Question 1: NIBRS Participation by State and Agency Type\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuestion: Which U.S. states and regions have lower levels of NIBRS adoption by law enforcement agencies, and are there patterns by geography or agency type?\nHypothesis: States with a mix of large cities and rural areas will have lower NIBRS participation due to variation in agency structure and a higher number of total agencies.\n\nThis question focuses no identifying U.S. states and regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) with the lowest levels of participation in NIBRS. Agency-level data was used to summarize participation status by state, then regional classifications were added to group the results by area. Agency type was also included to determine if low compliance rates were driven by common types (city, county) or more likely to occur in areas with a wider variety of smaller agencies.\n\n\nApproach\nTwo visualizations were created to explore current NIBRS participation by region, state, and agency type. The first, FBI Crime Reporting Participation, is a series of maps that uses a 50 state layout of the United States with inserts of Alaska and Hawaii for ease of viewing and to align with the agencies dataset, which does not include any additional U.S. territories. The maps were created using the sf package to handle spacial data and state shapes via the tigris package. There are two regional maps (with and without state outlines) that use grouped results for percent participation by region, as well as a state-level map with color fill representing participation levels. Plot animation was attempted using gganimate, but issues with the multi-layer region-only map led to a switch to a simple GIF created using magick.\nThe second plot, Reported vs Not Reported Agencies by Type, is a horizontal diverging bar chart of the number of agencies within the 10 states with the lowest reporting percentages. Each bar is stacked by agency type and split by reporting status (reporting on the right, non-reporting on the left). This format shows allows for visualization of the total number of agencies within these states, while allowing for division by agency type and reporting status. It was chosen to complement the map plot by providing more detail on the least compliant states and answer the second half of the Question 1.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nCode\nQ1_map_function &lt;- function(participation_column, subtitles, color1, region_outlines=NULL) {\n  Q1_map &lt;- ggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data=us_states, aes(fill={{ participation_column }}), color=color1, linewidth=0.5)\n  \n  # Layer only for region outlines\n  if (!is.null(region_outlines)) {\n    Q1_map &lt;- Q1_map + geom_sf(data=region_outlines, fill=NA, color=\"white\", linewidth=0.5)\n  }\n  Q1_map + scale_fill_viridis_c(\n      option=\"plasma\", direction=-1,\n      limits=c(0, 1),\n      breaks=c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),\n      labels=percent_format(accuracy=1)\n    ) +\n    coord_sf(\n      xlim=c(usbbox[\"xmin\"], usbbox[\"xmax\"]),\n      ylim=c(usbbox[\"ymin\"], usbbox[\"ymax\"]),\n      expand=FALSE,\n      datum=NA\n    ) +\n    labs(\n      title=\"FBI Crime Reporting Participation\",\n      subtitle=subtitles,\n      caption=\"Source: Shapefiles obtained using {tigris} R package, v2.0.1.\\nNIBRS participation data sourced via the TidyTuesday project (Feb 18, 2025).\\nRegional groupings based on CDC definitions.\",\n      fill=\"Percent Participating\"\n    ) +\n    theme_void()\n}\n\nQ1map1 &lt;- Q1_map_function(\n  participation_column=Region_Participation,\n  subtitles=\"By Region\",\n  color1=NA,\n  region_outlines=region_shapes\n  )\n\nQ1map2 &lt;- Q1_map_function(\n  participation_column=Region_Participation,\n  subtitles=\"By Region\",\n  color1=\"white\"\n)\n\nQ1map3 &lt;- Q1_map_function(\n  participation_column=Percent_Participating,\n  subtitles=\"By State\",\n  color1=\"white\"\n)\n\n#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65571964/create-fade-in-and-fade-out-gif-in-r-magick-package\n\nggsave(path=\"images\", filename=\"Q1map1.png\", Q1map1, width=6, height=3.5, dpi=150)\nggsave(path=\"images\", filename=\"Q1map2.png\", Q1map2, width=6, height=3.5, dpi=150)\nggsave(path=\"images\", filename=\"Q1map3.png\", Q1map3, width=6, height=3.5, dpi=150)\n\nmap1png &lt;- image_read(\"images/Q1map1.png\")\nmap2png &lt;- image_read(\"images/Q1map2.png\")\nmap3png &lt;- image_read(\"images/Q1map3.png\")\n\nQ1gif &lt;-  c(map1png, map2png, map3png, map2png) |&gt;\n  image_morph(25) |&gt;\n  image_animate(fps=5, optimize=TRUE) |&gt;\n  suppressMessages()\n\nimage_write(Q1gif, \"images/Q1animation.gif\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(agency_diverging, \n       aes(x=count, y=reorder(state, count), fill=agency_type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", position=\"stack\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=0, color=\"gray40\", linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option=\"plasma\") +  \n  labs(\n    title=\"Reported vs Not Reported Agencies by Type (10 lowest participation states)\",\n    caption=\"Source: FBI Crime Data API via the TidyTuesday project (Feb 18, 2025).\",\n    x=\"Number of Agencies (Not Reported | Reported)\",\n    y=\"State\",\n    fill=\"Agency Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe map and regional summary revealed that the Northeast region has the lowest overall NIBRS participation rate among U.S. regions at 46% compared to other regions that ranged from 84-90%. At the state level, Pennsylvania had the lowest reporting percentage at 11%, followed by Florida at 18%. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Community & Economic Development, PA has more police departments than any other state, with over half having less than 10 officers each. The sheer number of agencies, coupled with their smaller sizes, explains why has a larger, more negative, bar on the diverging plot compared to high population states like FL and CA. It may also have an outsized influence on the region, helping to explain the large gap betweent the Northeast and other regions. Pennsylvania and Florida both have a large number of non-city agencies as well, which aligns with my hypothesis that variation in agencies would be a contributing factor, though PA has a larger number of “city” agency types in the non-reporting bucket."

    "text": "Question 2: NIBRS Participation by State and Agency Type\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuestion: How has NIBRS participation expanded geographically from 1985 to 2024?\nHypothesis: NIBRS adoption has increased more rapidly in the last decade due to advancements in technology and broader adoption of centralized and streamlined data collection and reporting systems. I expect states with smaller populations to have higher adoption rates earlier, while more populous states will lag behind.\n\n\n\nApproach\nAgencies were grouped into decades based on when they joined NIBRS (1985-1994, 1995-2004, 2005-2014, 2015-2024). County data was obtained from tigris and joined to matching county names in the agencies.csv to approximately plot agency locations and visualize participation growth in each decade (longitude/latitude coordinates in the .csv resulted in more off-map points, either error on my end or a few incorrect points in the file). While a map with Hawaii and Alaska was used as the base, coordinates could not be mapped to the inserted states, so those agencies were removed as more realistic maps were difficult to read due to geographic spread. Results were faceted by decade to allow for growth comparisons.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data=us_states, fill=\"gray90\", color=\"white\") +\n  geom_sf(\n    data=agencies_plot, \n    aes(color=decade), \n    size=0.8, alpha=0.6\n    ) +\n  scale_color_manual(name=\"Decade\", \n                     values=c(\"purple4\", \"cyan3\", \"darkblue\", \"magenta\")) +\n   labs(\n    title=\"Expansion of NIBRS Participation by Decade (1985–2024)\",\n    caption = \"Source: Shapefiles obtained using {tigris} R package, v2.0.1.\\nNIBRS join dates sourced via the TidyTuesday project (Feb 18, 2025).\\nHawaii and Alaska agencies excluded from plot\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(datum=NA) +\n  facet_wrap(~decade) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nDuring the earliest period (1985-1994), agency participation appears fairly high on the East coast but sparce in the West. More expansion is seen from 1995-2014, particularly in the Northwest. In the last decade, far more expansion is seen in the West and other areas continue to see increases in participation and are now densely covered. While difficult to quantify from these maps, the hypothesis appears to hold true for the Southwest, which had delayed but significant adoption during the last decade."
