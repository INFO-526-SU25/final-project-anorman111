## Dataset

-   "Agencies from the FBI Crime Data API" released February 18th, 2025 for TidyTuesday

-   Sourced from the FBI's Crime Data API

-   Data related to participation in the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), a system for collecting detailed crime reports from law enforcement agencies

    -   Includes: agency names, locations (county, state, geographic coordinates), agency types, report start date

## Question 1: NIBRS Participation by State and Agency Type

**Question:** Which U.S. states and regions have lower levels of NIBRS adoption by law enforcement agencies, and are there patterns by geography or agency type?

-   Explored how U.S. NIBRS participation varies by state, region, and agency type with 2 visualizations:

    -   A series of U.S. maps showing participation by region and state (compiled as GIF)

    -   A diverging bar chart breaking down agency reporting by type in the 10 states with the lowest levels of participation

## Question 1: NIBRS Participation by State and Agency Type

-   Lowest participation region: **Northeast (46%)**

-   Lowest participation state: **Pennsylvania** **(11%)** which has the most police departments in the U.S.

    -   10 or less officers in over half of agencies

-   Contributing factors: Number and variety of agencies

## Question 2: NIBRS Participation Over Time

**Question:** How has NIBRS participation expanded geographically from 1985 to 2024?

-   Participation mapped by decade of adoption (1985--2024)

-   Agency growth shown in **faceted maps** to highlight regional expansion over time

## Question 2: NIBRS Participation Over Time

-   Early adoption (1985--1994) concentrated in Eastern states, sparse in the West

-   Expansion spread Northwest from 1995--2014, with increasing national coverage

-   Last decade shows substantial growth in the Southwest and continued gains elsewhere
